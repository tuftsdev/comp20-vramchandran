		In this lab, I used an XMLHTTPRequest in order to read in data from a page and 
	then parse it and print it out.  I worked for a couple hours on this project, and
	I did it alone.
		As for the question, you cannot request the data from a different origin
	while using XMLHttpRequest because of the Same-Origin Policy, which prevents scripts 
	from a particular page to access data on another page.
