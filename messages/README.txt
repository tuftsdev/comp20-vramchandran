Everything has been implemented correctly. There is a GoogleMaps API implemented to display markers with corresponding info windows that display train times. There is also another marker that displays your location and the closest train station to you with a line connecting you to that train station.
The GoogleAPI manual was a great help in implementing all these features, and I talked with a TA about how to complete this.
This assignment probably took me around 15 hours to complete.
